### Mission

We have implemented a version of the Publisher Subscriver pattern (also known as Observer pattern) to allow our components to communicate and share state when needed, whithout being tightly coupled.  This will afford us more ability to make low impact changes, as well as test each component with narrow and focused unit tests.

A cononical usage of the design can be seen in the `sample` package, and is diagramed below:
